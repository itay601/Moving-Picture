# Moving-Picture
simple app of moving picture using windows forms C# 

## Overview

This project is a simple C# WinForms application that demonstrates the creation and animation of buttons and images. The main functionality includes a "Start" button that, when clicked, dynamically generates a new button and a picture of Kali Linux. The button moves back and forth horizontally, while the images fall to the bottom of the form.

## Features

- **Dynamic Button Creation**: A new button is created when the "Start" button is clicked.
- **Kali Linux Image**: An image of Kali Linux is displayed and animated.
- **Button Animation**: The newly created button moves horizontally across the form.
- **Image Animation**: The images fall vertically until they reach the bottom of the form.

## How It Works

1. **Start Button**: 
   - Initiates the creation of a new button and an image.
   - The button moves horizontally, first to the right, then to the left.

2. **Button Movement**:
   - The button moves across the form, changing direction when it reaches the form's edge.

3. **Image Falling**:
   - Images of Kali Linux fall vertically, simulating gravity, until they hit the bottom of the form.

## Setup Instructions
